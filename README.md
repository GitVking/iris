# Iris data set analysis
The **Iris flower** data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis*. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (**Iris setosa**, **Iris virginica** and **Iris versicolor**), and *150* records under five attributes - **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, **petal width** and **species**. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

The iris data set is widely used as a beginner's dataset for machine learning purposes.
